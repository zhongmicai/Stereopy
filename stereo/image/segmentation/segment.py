    Implement cell segmentation by deep learning model.

    Parameters
    -----------------
    model_path
        the path to deep learning model.
    img_path
        the path to image file.
    out_path
        the path to output mask result.
    deep_crop_size
        deep crop size.
    overlap
        overlap size.
    gpu
        set gpu id, if `'-1'`, use cpu for prediction.
    tissue_seg_model_path
        the path of deep learning model of tissue segmentation, if set it to None, it would use OpenCV to process.
    tissue_seg_method
        the method of tissue segmentation, 1 is based on deep learning and 0 is based on OpenCV.
    post_processing_workers
        the number of processes for post-processing.
    is_water:
        The file name used to generate the mask. If true, the name ends with _watershed.
    tissue_seg_dst_img_path
        default to the img_path's directory.
    num_threads
        multi threads num of the model reading process
    need_tissue_cut
        whether cut image as tissue before cell segmentation
    version
        the version, version must be `v1` , `v1_pro`, `v3`

    Returns
